  <h4>
    You can play the TASTER game here. This is a development version of the software, so it may have some bugs, and features can change on a daily basis. Note also that the game is designed to be played on a tablet, so some features are not optimised for certain browsers.<br>
    <p>Known issues:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sound effects may not play in some versions of Internet Explorer</li>
      <li>The game may occasionally freeze in FireFox. This is a problem with how FireFox embeds content, not a problem with the game</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For best results, use Google Chrome.</p>
