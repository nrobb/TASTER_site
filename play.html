  <h2>
    You can play the TASTER game here. This is a development version of the software, so it may have some bugs, and features can change on a daily basis. Note also that the game is designed to be played on a tablet, so some features are not optimised for certain browsers. In particular, you might find that the sound effects do not play in some versions of Internet Explorer.
