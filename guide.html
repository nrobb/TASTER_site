<h1>Guide for Participants</h1>
<h3>To help us design our game, we'd like your child / the person you care for to play a selection of games over a period of two weeks, and tell us what they think of them. The information on this page is for parents / legal guardians.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>At the start of the two week period:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You can see the full list of games, along with a description of each game and a video, <a href="{{site.url}}/games">here</a>. Read about each game and watch the video. If there are any games that you don't want your child / the person you care for to play, then you don't have to consider those games any further.</li>
<li>For each game that you are happy for your child / the person you care for to play, follow this process:
<ul>
<li>Load the game in your web browser / install the game on your tablet.</li>
<li>Present the game to your child / the person you care for, without explaining the game to them.</li>
<li>Observe your child / the person you care for using the game for a brief period (less than 5 minutes).</li>
<li>For each game, make a note of how well your child / the person you care for understands what they are supposed to do in the game (Doesn't understand at all / Understands a little / Understands well). You'll need this information later, when you complete the Initial Comprehension Form. You can show your child / the person you care for <a href="{{site.url}}/images/TASTER_comprehension_faces.png" target="_blank">this image</a>, to help them decide.</li>
</ul>
<li>When you have completed this process for all the games, complete the <a href="{{site.url}}/initialComprehensionForm">Initial Comprehension Form</a>. You'll need to complete the form in one sitting, but if you've recorded your child's / the person you care for's progress throughout, the form should only take a minute or so to complete.</li>
<li>At this point you can explain each game further, so that your child / the person you care for fully understands how to play the game.</li>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>During the two week period:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Give your child / the person you care for free access to all the games that you are happy for them to play.</li>
<li>At the end of each day, you and your child / the person you care for should complete the <a href="{{site.url}}/dailyFeedbackForm">Daily Feedback Form</a>.</li>
<li>It is important that your child / the person you care for plays as many of the games as possible. Encourage them to try all the games, and not just their favourites.</li>
</ol>
<h3>After the two week period, a final form will become available for you and your child / the person you care for to complete.</h3>
