In the development of our game, we're working with some very talented artists. Over a few weeks, we'll be featuring some of their great character and background designs here on the blog. This week, we're featuring Francesca Kennedy, a 3rd year Animation student at Edinburgh College of Art.

Check out Francesca's work below, and don't forget to visit her [blog](http://francesca-jane-kennedy-animation.tumblr.com/) to see more.
