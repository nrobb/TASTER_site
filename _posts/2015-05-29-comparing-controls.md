title: Comparing control systems

The development of TASTER is continuing, and more play tests will be conducted in the coming months.

In order to get a clear indicator of how different game features can optimise conditions for learning transfer, we need to compare versions of the game which differ in one particular feature, with all other aspects of the versions exactly the same. This way, if players show behavioural and physiological states that we know suggest a higher level of engagement and arousal when playing one version of the game, we can assume that we have identified the right way to implement the variable feature.
At the moment, I’m working on the control system. This is because I can quite radically alter the gameplay experience by simply altering the way in which the player controls their character. In addition, the control system was one feature that I identified needed improvement from the first play testing session.

So the next time I test the game, the play testers will have to adapt to several different control systems, using buttons, gestures, and maybe even a virtual joystick. At the moment, I have three different systems implemented, but I need to do some more work to make the transitions between them clear and intuitive for the players.

I’ve also been doing some work to develop a system for automatically collecting player data from the game. This way, I can gather much more information, at a much greater level of detail, than previously, all sent automatically to a secure server as the children are playing the game. (Don’t worry though, I won’t be gathering any data that could be used to identify the players by a third party, and everything will be transmitted using a secure connection.)
