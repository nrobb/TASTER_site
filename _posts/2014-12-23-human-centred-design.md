Designing a great game is a difficult process. But when the game is targeted at players with very unique needs, it's even harder. The best way to overcome this problem is to treat the design as an iterative process and to involve the end-users throughout.

For that reason, we're currently working with a group of children with PWS. We're getting them to play a carefully chosen selection of [games](/games/), and to provide feedback about their preferences.

We'll be looking out for a range of information, not just about the kinds of games they enjoy, but also which games they understand best, which platform they prefer to play games on, and what kinds of controls they find easiest to use.

This is important because for any training program to work, people need to be highly motivated to engage in it. In other words, the more enjoyable our game is to play, the more children will play it, and the more effective the training it offers will be.
