In the development of our game, we're working with some very talented artists. Over a few weeks, we'll be featuring some of their great character and background designs here on the blog. This week, we're featuring Tyler Carrigan, an Animation student at Edinburgh College of Art.

Check out Tyler's work below, and don't forget to visit his [blog](http://tylercarrigananimation.blogspot.co.uk/) to see more.
