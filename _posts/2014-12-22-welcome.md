Over the course of the next 12 months, researchers at Queen's University Belfast will be developing a video game to help children with Prader-Willi Syndrome improve their task switching abilities. In turn, we hope that this will help to reduce the temper tantrums that often accompany a deficit in task swtiching in PWS populations.

Put simply, we think that by training the cognitive ability to switch between multiple tasks, we can help children with PWS cope better with unexpected changes to plans or routines. And we think that the best way to make cognitive training effective is to incorporate it in a really great game.

This blog will be primarily a development blog, where I document progress on the game as I create it. I'm the sole developer on the project, responsible for, not just the programming, but the art, animation and music too. So there will be something for everyone here, from character sketches and game design ideas to code snippets and technical issues.
