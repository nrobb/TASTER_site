In the development of our game, we're working with some very talented artists. Over a few weeks, we'll be featuring some of their great character and background designs here on the blog. This week, we're featuring Shelley Topping, a student at Ulster University.

Check out Shelley's work below, and visit her [website](http://www.shelleyannedesign.com/) to see more.
