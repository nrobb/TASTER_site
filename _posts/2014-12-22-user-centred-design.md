When designing a game for a population with very unique needs, it's extremely difficult to get things right first time. The best 
way to overcome this problem is to treat the design as an iterative process and to involve the end-users throughout.

For that reason, we're currently working with a group of children with PWS. We're getting them to play a carefully chosen selection 
of [games](/games/), and to provide feedback about their preferences.
