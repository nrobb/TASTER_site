title: New controls

The current version of TASTER has been set up to trial different control systems, so that I can find out which system children find easiest to use.

The first new control system uses a virtual joystick. Use your finger or thumb to move the joystick in any direction, and your character will move in the same direction:

The second new control system uses two buttons drawn on the screen. Your character moves forward continuously with this control system; use the buttons to steer them to the left or right:

The original controls are still there too: simply touch the screen at the location you want the character to move to.

The current version of the game will automatically switch between these control systems at specific times and in a specific order.
