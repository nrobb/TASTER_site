The current version of TASTER has been set up to trial different control systems, so that I can gauge which system children find easiest to use.

The first new control system uses a virtual joystick. Use your finger or thumb to move the joystick in any direction, and your character will move in the same direction:

The second new control system uses two buttons drawn on the screen. Your character moves forward continuously with this control system; use the buttons to steer them to the left or right:
