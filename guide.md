<h1>Guide for Participants</h1>
<h3>To help us design our game, we'd like your child / the person you care for to play a selection of games over a period of two weeks, and tell us what they think of them. The information on this page is for parents / legal guardians.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>At the start of the two week period:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You can see the full list of games, along with a description of each game and a video, <a href="{{site.url}}/games">here</a>. Read about each game and watch the video. If there are any games that you don't want your child to play, then you don't have to consider those games any further.</li>
<li>For each game that you are happy for your child to play, follow this process:
<ul>
<li>Load the game in your web browser / install the game on your tablet.</li>
<li>Present the game to your child, without explaining the game to them.</li>
<li>Observe your child using the game for a brief period (less than 5 minutes).</li>
<li>For each game, make a note of how well your child understands what they are supposed to do in the game.</li>
<li>Ask your child how well they understand what they are supposed to do in the game. Make a note of this.</li>
</ul>
<li>When you have completed this process for all the games, complete this form.</li>
<li>At this point you can explain each game further, so that your child fully understands how to play the game.</li>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>During the two week period:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Give your child free access to all the games that you are happy for them to play.</li>
<li>At the end of each day, you and your child should complete this form.</li>
</ol>
<h3>After the two week period, a final form will become available for you and your child to complete.</h3>
