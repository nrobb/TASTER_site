<h1>Guide for Participants</h1>
<h3>To help us design our game, we'd like your child / the person you care for to play a selection of games. Then we will ask you and your child / the person you care for to provide us with feedback about the games.</h3>
<h3>You can see the full list of games, along with a description of each game and a video, <a href="{{site.url}}/games">here</a>. Some of the games are played in a web browser, while others should be played on a tablet (Android tablet or iPad).</h3>
<h3>The TASTER project is based at <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/psy" target="_blank">Queen's University Belfast</a>, and is funded by the <a href="http://www.fpwr.org" target="_blank">Foundation for Prader-Willi Research</a>.</h3>
<h3>If you are the parent or carer of someone with PWS and would like to take part in our research, the video below provides more information.</h3>
