<h1>Guide for Participants</h1>
<h3>To help us design our game, we'd like your child / the person you care for to play a selection of games. Then we will ask you and your child / the person you care for to provide us with feedback about the games.</h3>
<h3>You can see the full list of games, along with a description of each game and a video, <a href="{{site.url}}/games">here</a>. Some of the games are played in a web browser, while others should be played on a tablet (Android tablet or iPad).</h3>
<h3>Once you have installed all the games, we would like you to introduce your child / the person you care for to each game in turn. It doesn't matter what order you do this for each game. Also, if there is any game that you do not want your child / the person you care for to play, then that is fine.</h3>
<h3>When you first introduce your child / the person you care for to a game, we would like you to simply observe them</h3>
