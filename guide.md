<h1>Guide for Participants</h1>
<h3>To help us design our game, we'd like your child / the person you care for to play a selection of games and tell us what they think of them.</h3>
<h3>You can see the full list of games, along with a description of each game and a video, <a href="{{site.url}}/games">here</a>. Some of the games are played in a web browser, while others should be played on a tablet (Android tablet or iPad).</h3>
