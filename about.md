<p><h1>TASTER -  Training Attention Switching for Temper Episode Reduction.</h1></p>
<p><h2>We know that individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome have particular difficulties with a brain process called "task switching" or "attention switching". These difficulties are linked the strong preference for routine that lots of people with the syndrome show. They are also linked to the emotional upset and behaviours such as temper outbursts that individuals can show when things change in their routines or plans.</h2></p>
<p>The TASTER project aims to develop a first prototype of a video game to train task switching ability. The game is being designed with an emphasis on the particular needs of people with PWS. What we learn in this project will be critically important in helping us to further refine the game into an effective tool to help individuals with PWS deal with changes more easily and show less difficult behaviours like temper outbursts when things change.</p>
